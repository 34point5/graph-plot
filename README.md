# graph-plot
Easily plot beautiful, publication-quality function graph plots.
Provide the points to be plotted (which is easily done if you know the function), and you're good to go.

Horizontal and vertical limits can be defined.
For trigonometric plots, you can have grid lines drawn at multiples of pi.
Grid spacing can be customised, too.
