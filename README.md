# Shameless Telemarketing-style Promotion
Easily plot beautiful, publication-quality function graph plots. Provide the
points to be plotted (which is easily done if you know the function), and
you're good to go.

Horizontal and vertical limits can be defined. For trigonometric plots, you can
have grid lines drawn at multiples of pi. Grid spacing can be customised, too.

# Requirements
* Matplotlib
* NumPy

You also must have some basic knowledge about these two modules.

# Usage
Read [customplot\_example.pdf](customplot\_example.pdf) for instructions.

You may want to change the `savefig.directory` Matplotlib RC parameter (it's
somewhere at the top in the file `customplot.py`) or remove that line
altogether. (If you don't do this, it won't really cause any problems.)

Then run the program using `python3 customplot.py` or whatever python command
you are using.
