# Shameless Telemarketing-style Promotion
Easily plot beautiful, publication-quality function graph plots. Provide the
points to be plotted (which is easily done if you know the function), and
you're good to go.

Horizontal and vertical limits can be defined. For trigonometric plots, you can
have grid lines drawn at multiples of pi. Grid spacing can be customised, too.

# Usage
Change the `savefig.directory` Matplotlib RC parameter (it's somewhere at the
top in the file `customplot.py`) or remove that line altogether. Then run the
program using `python3 customplot.py` or whatever python command you are using.

Some basic knowledge of Matplotlib and Pyplot may be required.
